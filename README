This is just for swig at the moment doing. I may look at doing a dual release for both C++ and python if I can reconcile directory structure


Installation
python setup.py build_ext install

Check the dxflib help or the source of dl_entities.h and dl_creationinterface.h for ideas of what data you can get out. And test.py in the test for how to use the library. I'll improve that in a bit
